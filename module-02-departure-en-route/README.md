## Progression and Difficulty

Module 2 challenges build progressively in complexity:

1. **Challenge 2.1:** Introduces post-takeoff environment, single frequency transition
2. **Challenge 2.2:** Adds complexity with multiple rapid frequency changes
3. **Challenge 2.3:** Introduces optional radar service with additional coordination
4. **Challenge 2.4:** Combines all skills during dynamic maneuvering flight

Each challenge assumes mastery of previous challenges and Module 1 foundation.

## Key Frequencies

| Facility | Frequency | Usage |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| KPAO Tower | 118.6 | Takeoff clearances, initial departure |
| NorCal Departure | 120.9 | Primary departure control frequency used |
| Bay Approach | 125.35, 120.90, 127.8 | Various approach sectors |

## Teaching Approach

### Module 2 Philosophy

Building on Module 1's foundation, Module 2 introduces the faster-paced, more dynamic environment of flight. The teaching approach emphasizes:

- **Progressive workload management** - Each challenge adds complexity while reinforcing previous skills
- **Organizational techniques** - Writing down frequencies, maintaining awareness during busy moments
- **Realistic scenarios** - Multiple controllers, traffic calls, rapid changes
- **Safety emphasis** - Prioritizing aircraft control over perfect radio work
- **Professional standards** - Appropriate phraseology for each situation

### Shirley's Role

Shirley continues as a patient, encouraging instructor who:

- **Acknowledges increased complexity** - "Things happen faster in the air" is normalized
- **Teaches organizational systems** - Writing frequencies, position reports structure
- **Emphasizes priorities** - Fly, navigate, communicate in that order
- **Provides realistic ATC responses** - Multiple controllers with different styles
- **Celebrates multitasking success** - Managing flying and communication simultaneously
- **Maintains safety focus** - Traffic awareness, altitude coordination critical

---

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Frequency Change Overload
**Solution:** Writing down frequencies before acknowledging, one step at a time approach

### Challenge: Missing Radio Calls During Maneuvers
**Solution:** Maintaining volume, completing maneuver to stable state before responding

### Challenge: Confusion About Controller Expectations
**Solution:** Different initial contact formats taught explicitly for each controller type

### Challenge: Flight Following Request Incomplete
**Solution:** Clear format taught: destination + altitude + squawk

### Challenge: Task Saturation in Practice Area
**Solution:** Emphasis on flying first, brief responses, pausing maneuvers if needed
